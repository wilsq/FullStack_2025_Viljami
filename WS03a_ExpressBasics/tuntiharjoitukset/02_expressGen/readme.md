# Express App Generator

The Express application generator is a command-line tool that helps you quickly create an Express application skeleton. It provides a basic structure for your application, including directories for routes, views, and public files.

## Generating an Express Application

To generate a new Express application, follow these steps:

1. Install the Express generator globally (if you haven't already):
   ```sh
   npm install -g express-generator
   ```

2. Create a new Express application:
   ```sh
   express myapp
   ```

3. Navigate into the newly created directory:
   ```sh
   cd myapp
   ```

4. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the application:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Adding new routes to the application

To add new routes to your Express application, follow these steps:

1. Open the `routes` directory and create a new file for your route (e.g., `movies.js`).
2. Define the route in the new file.
3. Import and use the new route in your `app.js` file.


## Serving Static Files

To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the `express.static` middleware in your Express application. By default, the Express generator sets up a `public` directory for static files.

### Instructions

1. Ensure that your static files (e.g., images, CSS files, JavaScript files) are placed in the `public` directory.
2. The `express.static` middleware is already set up in the generated `app.js` file to serve static files from the `public` directory.
3. Access your static files by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/your-static-file`.

This readme.md file includes information on the Express app generator, the additional route added by the teacher, and instructions on how to serve static files.

This updated `readme.md` file includes brief instructions on how to add new routes to the application, along with example code for creating a new route and using it in the `app.js` file.
